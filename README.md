# Mistable

This repository is the **canonical system spine** for the Mistable ecosystem.

It defines:
- explicit contracts and interfaces
- a task-driven workflow
- deterministic tooling and execution

Everything else in the Mistable organization builds on top of this repository.

If you are new here, **start here**.
